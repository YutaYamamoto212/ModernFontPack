# Modern Font Pack
Are you tired of Minecraft's thick and large default fonts? Even if you have Force Unicode Font enabled, it will look rough on high resolution screens. This resource pack will solve these problems so that you can see a more beautiful, modern and smooth font when you play Minecraft.  

## Three Major Versions - HD, Basic, Supreme  
Due to different screen resolutions, and Minecraft's font rendering is not resampled as the interface size changes, the same resource pack will appear differently on different screens. In order to provide the desired effect, three major versions have been developed - HD, Basic and Supreme.  

### HD
Suitable for GUI Scale 3 or above, or game screen resolution of 1024×768, 1280×720, 1366×768, 1280×1024, 1440×900, 1920×1080 or above, or general mobile phones and tablets. Both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition are supported.

The above fonts are available in 5 variants, namely JP, KR, CN, TW and HK. The font is taken from the [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans) font family, commissioned by Google.  

## Emoji Support
The font is taken from the [Noto Emoji](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Emoji) font family, commissioned by Google. Due to technical limitations, most emoji can only be displayed in Java Edition 1.16 or above.

## Fancy Text Support
Fonts are taken from:  
- [Manuskript Gothisch](https://www.1001fonts.com/manuskript-gothisch-font.html), designed by Peter Wiegel.  
- [Gloucester Open Face](https://www.1001freefonts.com/gloucester-open-face.font), designed by Roger White.  
- [Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico), commissioned by Google.  
- [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans), commissioned by Google.  
- [Noto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif), commissioned by Google.  
- [Noto Sans Mono](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Mono), commissioned by Google.  

To use them, you don't need to use commands like `/tellraw` and `/title`. You just need to use any online fancy text generator, then copy the fancy text and paste it in the game.  
Due to technical limitations, most fancy text can only be displayed in Java Edition 1.16 or above.
